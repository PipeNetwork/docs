## üõ†Ô∏è Key Components

### Pipe CDN
Hyperlocal content delivery designed for video, gaming, dApps, and AI workloads with sub-10ms latency.

### Firestarter Storage
Decentralized origin storage integrated with delivery, supporting client-side encryption and various storage tiers.

### P1 Overlay Network
Software-defined routing layer that finds the fastest paths across multiple networks.

## üíª System Requirements

### For PoP Node Operators
- Linux operating system
- Minimum 16GB RAM (32GB+ recommended for production)
- 100GB+ SSD storage
- 1Gbps+ network connection
- 24/7 internet connectivity


### For Storage Users
- Rust/Cargo for building pipe-cli
- Solana DevNet SOL for transactions
