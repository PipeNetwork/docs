## üõ†Ô∏è Key Components

### Pipe CDN
Hyperlocal content delivery designed for video, gaming, dApps, and AI workloads with sub-10ms latency.

### Firestarter Storage
Decentralized origin storage integrated with delivery, supporting client-side encryption and various storage tiers.

### P1 Overlay Network
Software-defined routing layer that finds the fastest paths across multiple networks.

## üíª System Requirements

### For PoP Node Operators
- Linux operating system
- Minimum 4GB RAM (16GB+ recommended for production)
- 100GB+ SSD storage
- 1Gbps+ network connection
- 24/7 internet connectivity

## Auto Installations

### Features
- ‚úÖ One-command installation of the Pipe POP Node
- üîß Automatically generates a .env configuration file
- üî• Opens required firewall ports (80 & 443)
- üß± Runs as a persistent systemd service
- üíæ Built-in cache management for improved performance

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

**Download the setup script to your server:**
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pipenetwork/docs/main/install/auto.sh
nano setup-pop-node.sh
```
**Inside the script, you can customize your node settings in the .env section:**
```bash
NODE_SOLANA_PUBLIC_KEY="your_solana_wallet_address"
NODE_NAME="my-pop-node"
NODE_EMAIL="operator@example.com"
NODE_LOCATION="San Francisco, USA"

MEMORY_CACHE_SIZE_MB=512
DISK_CACHE_SIZE_GB=100
DISK_CACHE_PATH="/root/cache"

HTTP_PORT=80
HTTPS_PORT=443
UPNP_ENABLED=true
```
**Once you‚Äôre done editing, make the script executable and run it as root:** 
```bash
chmod +x setup-pop-node.sh
sudo ./setup-pop-node.sh
```



### For Storage Users
- Rust/Cargo for building pipe-cli
- Solana DevNet SOL for transactions

## üìñ Getting Started

1. **New to Pipe Network?** Start with the [Introduction](docs/getting-started/introduction.md)
2. **Want to run a node?** Check out the [DevNet 2 setup guide](docs/nodes/devnet-2.md)
3. **Need storage?** Learn about [Firestarter Storage](docs/pipe-firestarter-storage.md)
